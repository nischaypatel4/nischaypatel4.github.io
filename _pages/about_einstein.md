Hi! I'm Nischay Patel, a Pre-Final year B.Tech student in Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at IIT Kanpur. My primary interests lie in Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Cognitive Science, where I focus on bridging research with practical applications. I’ve had the privilege of contributing to core research projects at renowned labs such as IIT Gandhinagar’s PMDCB Lab and IIT Kanpur’s Lab of Neural Systems. Additionally, I’m passionate about applying machine learning and data analytics to uncover insights and identify patterns in complex datasets. 

When I'm not working, you can find me playing Table Tennis or Cricket. Check out my [publications page](/nischaypatel4.github.io/publications/) and learn more about the exciting [projects](/nischaypatel4.github.io/projects/) I’ve been working on!
